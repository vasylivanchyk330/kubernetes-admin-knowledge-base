# Kubernetes Admin Things - CKA Knowledge Base

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base that I compiled while preparing for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam. It contains structured notes, guides, and configurations that cover key concepts and operational tasks in Kubernetes.

## Contents

- `backing-up`: Steps and best practices for backing up Kubernetes cluster data.
- `cluster-upgrade`: Procedures and checks for safely upgrading a Kubernetes cluster.
- `networking`: Notes on Kubernetes networking concepts, including services, ingress, and network policies.
- `security`: Security practices, including RBAC, secrets management, and network security.
- `troubleshooting`: Guides and tips for troubleshooting common Kubernetes issues.

## Contributions

Contributions to this knowledge base are welcome. If you have suggestions or corrections, please submit a pull request with your proposed changes.

## Acknowledgments

- The Kubernetes community for providing extensive documentation and support.
- The creators of the CKA certification for structuring a comprehensive curriculum for Kubernetes administrators.
